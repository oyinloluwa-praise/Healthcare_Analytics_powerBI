Healthcare Analytics Dashboard: Patient Outcomes & Operational Efficiency

Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard designed to monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for a network of hospitals. The dashboard tracks patient admissions, insurance demographics, medication distribution, and clinical conditions to help healthcare administrators make data-driven decisions.

Tools Used

Data Visualization: Power BI

Data cleaning: Power BI

Reporting: GitHub Portfolio

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Total Admissions: 55,000

2. Unique Patients: 40,000

3. Total Doctors: 40,300

4. Average Length of Stay (LOS): 15.5 Days

5. Average Patient Bill: $34.9K

Insights & Data Analysis

1. Admission Trends
   
Significant Decline: There was a sharp 47.58% decrease in total admissions between 2019 and 2024.

Peak Period: Admissions peaked around 2021-2023 but saw a drastic drop-off in 2024 (falling by 64.94% in the last two years).

2. Demographic Analysis
   
Age Distribution: The 65+ age group represents the highest volume of patients, followed by the 51-60 demographic. This indicates a geriatric-focused patient base.

Gender Balance: The patient split is nearly identical, with 50.1% Male and 49.9% Female.

Insurance Coverage: Market share is evenly split among top providers (Cigna, Medicare, Blue Cross, UnitedHealth, and Aetna), with each holding approximately 20% of the patient base.

3. Clinical & Medication Trends
   
Medication Volume: Lipitor is the most prescribed medication (9,430 patients), followed by Ibuprofen and Aspirin.

Condition Prevalence: Arthritis is the leading condition across the dataset (8,019 patients), followed by Diabetes and Hypertension.

Blood Type Correlations: B+ and AB+ blood types represent the highest patient totals, though the distribution across all types is relatively uniform.

Recommendations

Operational Efficiency

Investigate Admission Drop: The 64.94% drop in admissions since 2022 needs a root-cause analysis. Is this due to improved preventative care, facility closures, or data reporting gaps?

Optimize LOS: An average Length of Stay of 15.5 days is relatively high. Implementing a "Fast-Track" discharge process for low-risk conditions could reduce costs and free up beds.

Strategic Marketing & Care

Senior Care Focus: Given that the 65+ age group is the largest segment, the facility should invest more in geriatric specialized services and mobility-friendly infrastructure.

Chronic Disease Management: With Arthritis, Diabetes, and Hypertension being the top conditions, the hospital should launch specialized chronic disease management programs to improve long-term patient outcomes.

Revenue & Billing

Billing Transparency: With an average bill of $34.9K, the facility should ensure seamless integration with the five major insurance providers to minimize out-of-pocket friction for patients.
